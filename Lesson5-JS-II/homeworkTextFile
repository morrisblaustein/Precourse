A for loop gives programmers a way to create a loop that runs each time with a different index. An index is generally the count of how many times the for loop has iterated, but can also hold other values.

&&, ||, and ! are ways of controlling logic of your program. They are used in conjunction with boolean values, and can be grouped to create larger logic implemenations.
